# Chapter I: \LARGE{Overview of Statistics}

## What is Statistics?

\LARGE{\textbf{Most researchers or people think}}

\large{Statistics makes us insane...}

\LARGE{\textbf{However}}

\large{Statistics sometimes gives us very useful information from data!!}

\large{So then, what is statistics??}

## Main Pillars of Statistics 
\LARGE

### The most important things in statistics 
\normalsize

1. Data (sample)
    - Investigation, experiment, and survey
    - Gathering numbers (for quantitative analysis)
2. Description or Summarization
    - Table, chart, and so on
    - Based on summarized statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation, median, ...)
3. Inference
    - Numerous statistical tests and models based on probability theory
    - e.g. two-sample t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, regression, and so on

## Why should we collect data (sample)? 

### Measure everything in everywhere

- Advantages
    - You will get exactly correct answer
    - No need to meet an awkward statistician LIKE ME

- Disadvantages 
    - Typing ``SHOW ME THE MONEY'' may help your budget
    - Time is TOO SHORT TO COLLECT everything

### Inferential approach

  - If we have a proper sample that represents the whole population, you can get NEARLY the correct answer

## Type of variables 

1. 명목척도(norminal): 성별, 혈액형, 지역, 인종 

# Type of Studies

## Overview 

\LARGE{\textbf{Research or trial?}}

### Research

\normalsize{자료의 수집과 분석 목적이 학술적 목적에 국한된 모든 종류의 연구 및 실험}

### Trial

\normalsize{자료의 수집과 분석 목적이 이윤추구 또는 허가에 목적이 있는 임상시험}

## Observational Study

### Cross-sectional study (단면적 관찰연구)

1. prevalence study
2. Diagostic test
3. Ecological study 
4. Validity, Reliability, and agreement study

### Longitudinal study (종단적 관찰연구)

1. Prospective study
2. Retrospective study

## Experimental Study

### Randomized controlled trial 

### Pilot study

### Exploratory study

### Confirmative study


# Type of outcome variables

## Primary outcomes

## Secondary outcomes

## Surrogate variables

## Global assessment variable

# Sample size calculation

## Overview

### Two approaches

1. Based on the marginal error rate $\rightarrow$ population based observational study
2. Based on the effectiveness between concerning groups $\rightarrow$ experimental study
  
\textbf{Both approaches are based on previous studies}

\textbf{Is your study entirely new?}

## Observational study

## Observational study: prevalence study

## Observational study: prevalence study

## Parallel design

## $2\times 2$ cross-over design 

## Factorial design

# Multiple comparison

## What makes data significant?

1. Data themselves contain unexpected errors
2. Bias
3. Just conincidence
4. Our hypothesis is working

## Torturing data

# Statistical Analysis 

## Overview

## Independent two sample t-test

1. Too easy, but very useful methodology for the comparison of sample means between two groups

## Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

## Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)

## Simple or multiple regression

## Repeated Measures ANOVA

## Linear mixed effects model 

## Reliability analysis 

### Cohen's $\kappa$

### Cronbach's $\alpha$

### Intra Class Correlation (ICC)
